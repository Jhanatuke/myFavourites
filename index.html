    <p class="center">I love keyboards. Ever since 2020, I have been collecting mechanical keyboards. I currently own around 10 or 11, most of which ive built myself. There are many different components that go into a keyboard, however the most important are the switches. The switches are the buttons themselves, and each switch has its own distinct feel and sound. Here is an ordered list of my favourite keyboard switches.</p>
    <ol><li>Banana Split Switches</li>
    <li>Kale switches</li>
<li>Cherry mx red switches</li></ol>
